h1. Development Environemnt

h2. 1) Linux Setup

There are two approaches to establish and access Linux environment from your  computer. Approach #1 listed in this section is preferred for it allows you to use the Linux with super user privilege.

h3. 1a) Approach #1: Linux Development Server (ADS or LDS)

* Download a 32-bits Ubuntu Linux OS image from [Ubuntu Download|http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop].

* Download VMWare Player from [VMWare Download|https://www.vmware.com/support/download-player.html] and install it on your computer.

* Follow instructions to install Ubuntu as guest OS on VMWare Player: [Install Ubuntu|http://partnerweb.vmware.com/GOSIG/Ubuntu_12_04_LTS.html]

h3. 1b) Approach #2: Linux Guest OS on VMWare

Refer to [Smart Agent Development Environment Page|http://wikicentral.cisco.com/display/ELO/Client+Development#ClientDevelopment-LinuxVM%28ADS%29] for information about requesting ADS account and using VNC client to connect to ADS server.

h2. 2) Workspace Setup

* Install Java 7 on your Linux if you haven't.

* Download [Maven 3|http://maven.apache.org/index.html] and install it on Linux.

* Download [JRuby 1.7.9|http://www.jruby.org/download] and install it on Linux.

* Download [jrubycForMaven Plugin|https://github.com/fernandezpablo85/jrubycForMaven/archive/master.zip] and run "mvn clean install" to install the plugin in your local Maven repository.

* Pull the NESAL source code from Git repository. (TBD) 

* Run the following commands to start a build of NESAL package.

{code}
cd nesal
mvn install
{code}


h2. 3) IDE Setup

* Install Eclipse for Java EE (Kepler release).

* From Eclipse, select "File->Import", chose "Existing Maven Project", browse to 
  "nesal" directory of and click "Finish".

h2. 4) Additional Notes for Ruby

Compile Ruby script to Java source code:
 
* Create Ruby scripts in nesal/src/main/ruby directory.
* Add "java_package" and "java_signature" in the Ruby script, for example:

{code}
require 'java'
java_package 'com.cisco.nesal.internal'

class RubySample

    java_signature 'void bar(int, int)'
    def bar(a,b)
        puts a + b
    end
end
{code}

* Run "mvn compile". The generated Java source code will be saved in nesal/src/main/java/com/cisco/nesal/internal.
